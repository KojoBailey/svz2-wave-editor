# SvZ2 Wave Editor
This is a **Wave editor** for my mod, ***[Samurai vs Zombies Defense 2: Kaizen](https://github.com/KojoBailey/SvZ2-Kaizen)***.

For now, at least, the data this tool produces only works with *Kaizen*, since *Kaizen* significantly revamps and reprograms the Wave system.

## Usage
This tool is currently in-development, with no releases yet available. Stay tuned for future updates!
